# InfiniFlow: Optimal Traffic Flow Management using Deep Learning 

**InfiniFlow** is an AI-based smart traffic management system that dynamically **adjusts traffic signal timings based on traffic density** and **gives priority to emergency vehicles** such as ambulances and fire engines using **YOLOv8 and OpenCV**.

---

##  Aim of the Project
- Analyze real-time traffic density at intersections  
- Dynamically adjust traffic signal timings to optimize flow  
- Detect emergency vehicles (ambulance, fire engines)  
- Provide signal priority to emergency vehicles to reduce response time  

---

##  Project Overview
Urban traffic congestion and delayed emergency responses are critical problems in cities.  
This project uses **computer vision and deep learning** to:
1. Detect vehicles on each lane from traffic videos/images  
2. Calculate traffic density per lane  
3. Adjust signal timing dynamically to reduce congestion  
4. Give **priority to emergency vehicles**, overriding normal signal rules

- Real-time vehicle detection using **YOLOv8**  
- Traffic density estimation for each lane  
- Dynamic traffic signal adjustment  
- Emergency vehicle (ambulance & fire engine) detection  
- Image and video-based inference
